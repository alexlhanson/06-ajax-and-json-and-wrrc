The user needs to scaffold out the HTML with a nav and templates for articles and filters using Handlebars. Then the user needs to setup some basic CSS for the nav, footer and template article.  Then the user needs to setup and article Constructor Object from database.  Then the user needs to add filters for author name and category and populate them.  Then the user needs to hide and show articles according to filter.  Then the user needs to create nav functionality that shows/hides parts of the page.
